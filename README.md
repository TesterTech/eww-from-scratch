# eww-from-scratch

- move files in dot_config to .config, ```cd  dot_config/ ``` ```mv eww ~/.config``` 
- Put your username in eww.scss where it says <YOUR USERNAME> (line 1)
  - NOTE: the script expects ~/.cache/wal/colors.scss to be there, 
  this is created by Pywal so make sure to have that or remove the line! 
  - I put a colors.sccc in dot_cache/wal/ directory so you could use that temporarily.
